# Class Tracker (Dip Soft) React Front End Project

An attempt at a react demonstration for working with an ASP.NET Core RESTful API

## Goal

This project will be making use of the react hooks api, and is a learning experience, moving over from ASP.net Core MVC SSR applications to an attempt at a React Js SPA, exploring the many differences and (hopefully) leaving useful comments in the codebase for anyone else making a similar transition

## Usage

If connecting this to an Example API, Ensure that a CORS policy is set in the API.

<small>An example of setting up 'open' CORS in .Net Core Web API can be found in another repository on my Github</small>

-   The API URI may need to be adjusted in the Teacher Context system

-   The project can be run in development mode using `npm start`

### Disclaimer

This is in no way a demosntration of best practises, or a repository created by a Javascript professional, my background is in C# and ASP.NET Core in particular, so the Javascript concepts used here may be used incorrectly, or inefficiently in the initial revisions of this repository
